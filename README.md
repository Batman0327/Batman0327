<h1 align = "centre"> ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Abhishek Singh!</h1>

ðŸŒŸ About Me

I'm a passionate computer enthusiast from India, currently pursuing a Master's in Cyber Security at the University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, England. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Applications in 2020 and have gained extensive experience across various domains, including healthcare IT, software testing, and cybersecurity.

When I'm not diving into code or cybersecurity tools, you'll find me meditating, trekking, or exploring new places. I'm also a fitness freak and love to challenge myself both mentally and physically. Learning new programming languages is something I do for fun, and I'm always eager to expand my skill set.
